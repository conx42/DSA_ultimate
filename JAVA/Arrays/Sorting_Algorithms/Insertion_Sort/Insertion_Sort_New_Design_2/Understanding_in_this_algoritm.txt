{
if our algorithm includes -> [j-1] instead [i]/'i--'
and not_doing -> 'i--' at any step
}
we may not include 'break;' statement, and infinite loop will not happen.
Q) why the loop will not run infinitely (without break; statement)?
Ans:- Because inner-Loop(or j-th Loop) will terminate anyway, 
	  so that's why there is no chance of infinite loop.
NOTE:-
	Though the algorithm is working, but in our understanding using 'break;' is a good practice.
	Because we don't want to iterate over the Already-sorted-Array.
