{
if our algorithm includes -> i
and doing -> 'i--' at any step
}
we have to include 'break;' statement, otherwise the loop will run infinitely.
Q) why the loop will run infinitely (without break; statement)?
Ans:- in inner-Loop(or j-th Loop) i will come to index = 0 
	  && after that the outer-Loop(or i-th Loop) again iterate
	  the sorted array again. By this way it makes an infinite loop without break;
